# Docker Setup

You won't use Docker until much later in the course, but it is required to be installed.

## macOS and Windows

Just visit [docker.com] and download and install the latest
version of Docker Desktop.  Docker for Windows requires WSL 2 to be already
configured and working.

## Ubuntu Linux

Installing Docker on Ubuntu Linux is a little more involved, as there isn't a
download on the main docker page. Docker does have an easy-to-use
convenience script that will install docker for you using curl.

You can read [Install using the convenience-script] for more info about this.

But it involves running these commands:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

Then, in order for you to be able to run the docker commands without using `sudo`
you should run this command, replacing `your-user` with your linux user name. Remember, you can type `whoami` to find out what this is.

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
```
